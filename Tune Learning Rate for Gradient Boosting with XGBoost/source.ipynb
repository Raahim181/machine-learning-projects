    "# Tune Learning Rate for Gradient Boosting with XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with gradient boosted decision trees is that they are quick to learn and overfit training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One effective way to slow down learning in the gradient boosting model is to use a learning rate, also called shrinkage (or eta in XGBoost documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will discover the effect of the learning rate in gradient boosting and how to tune it on your machine learning problem using the XGBoost library in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The effect learning rate has on the gradient boosting model.\n",
    "- How to tune learning rate on your machine learning on your problem?\n",
    "- How to tune the trade-off between the number of boosted trees and learning rate on your problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slow Learning in Gradient Boosting with a Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting involves creating and adding trees to the model sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "New trees are created to correct the residual errors in the predictions from the existing sequence of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is that the model can quickly fit, then overfit the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A technique to slow down the learning in the gradient boosting model is to apply a weighting factor for the corrections by new trees when added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This weighting is called the shrinkage factor or the learning rate, depending on the literature or the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive gradient boosting is the same as gradient boosting with shrinkage where the shrinkage factor is set to 1.0. Setting values less than 1.0 has the effect of making less corrections for each tree added to the model. This in turn results in more trees that must be added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to have small values in the range of 0.1 to 0.3, as well as values less than 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s investigate the effect of the learning rate on a standard machine learning dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description: Otto Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Otto Group Product Classification Challenge [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset describes the 93 obfuscated details of more than 61,000 products grouped into 10 product categories (e.g. fashion, electronics, etc.). Input attributes are counts of different events of some kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make predictions for new products as an array of probabilities for each of the 10 categories and models are evaluated using multiclass logarithmic loss (also called cross entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a good challenge for XGBoost because of the nontrivial number of examples, the difficulty of the problem and the fact that little data preparation is required (other than encoding the string class variables as integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuning Learning Rate in XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating gradient boosting models with XGBoost using the scikit-learn wrapper, the **learning_rate** parameter can be set to control the weighting of new trees added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the grid search capability in scikit-learn to evaluate the effect on logarithmic loss of training a gradient boosting model with different learning rate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will hold the number of trees constant at the default of 100 and evaluate of suite of standard values for the learning rate on the Otto dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "learning_rate = [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 variations of learning rate to be tested and each variation will be evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, meaning that there is a total of 6×10 or 60 XGBoost models to be trained and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log loss for each learning rate will be printed as well as the value that resulted in the best performance."
